    <p> Hey, my name is Josh. </p>
     <p>I have always had an interest in coding and in computers, and would love to get a better understanding of how to write code and create websites/software.</p>
     <p> I currently manage(2IC) a removals/transport business, but would like to change careers to something I have a passion for and get into coding. </p>
